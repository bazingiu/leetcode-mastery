## 🛠️ Repository Structure

### 🧠 Pattern-Based Solutions
The `Pattern/` directory contains solutions organized by algorithmic strategy—the most effective way to prepare for technical interviews.

| Category | Problem | Difficulty | Complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Arrays** | [Two Sum (#1)](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) | 🟢 Easy | $O(n)$ |
| **DP** | [Climbing Stairs (#70)](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/) | 🟢 Easy | $O(n)$ |
| **Sliding Window** | [Longest Substring (#3)](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/) | 🟡 Medium | $O(n)$ |
| **Two Pointers** | [Container With Most Water (#11)](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/) | 🟡 Medium | $O(n)$ |
| **Greedy** | [Best Time to Buy Stock (#121)](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/) | 🟢 Easy | $O(n)$ |

### 🏗️ Data Structures Implementation
In `DataStructure/`, I dive deep into "under the hood" implementations of core data structures.

* **Bit Manipulation**: Advanced operations and binary property analysis.
* **Discrete Math**: Combinations and permutations (essential for Backtracking problems).
* **Tries**: Prefix Tree implementations for efficient string searching and autocomplete logic.

### 🐍 Python Syntax & Tricks
The `Python_syntax/` folder serves as a quick-reference for language-specific features (e.g., `slicing`, `list comprehensions`, `itertools`) that enable writing clean, "Pythonic," and high-performance code during timed challenges.

## 🚀 How to Run
Each solution is self-contained. You can execute them locally to verify the logic:

```bash
# Example: Running the Two Sum solution
